# MostlyMoviesBot
A Discord bot that is mostly for movie information and interaction with a focus on Letterboxd info/data

This is the discord server that I'm making it for and testing it on: https://discord.gg/MpC9NCrfmS 


HELP:

I'm a python novice, I dabbled with it a little a few years ago.

I want my bot to be able to pull information and respond with links and images depending on the command.


Any help is very much welcome. Thank you.
