# MostlyMoviesBot
A Discord bot that is mostly for movie information and interaction with a focus on Letterboxd info/data

This is the discord server that I'm making it for and testing it on: https://discord.gg/MpC9NCrfmS 


HELP:

I'm a python novice, I dabbled with it a little a few years ago.

I want my bot to be able to: if someone puts the command !f followed by a movie title (e.g: !f Toy Story ) then the bot responds with a letterboxd.com link to the film: "https://letterboxd.com/film/toy-story/".


Any help is very much welcome. Thank you.
